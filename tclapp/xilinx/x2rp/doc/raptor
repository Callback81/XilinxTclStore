
Description: 

    Implements the 2RP Design using DCP files as sources.

Arguments:

    <top> - (Required) Design top name.

    <shell> - (Required) RL/Shell instance path.

    <level_0> - (Required) Level 0 dcp file, contains only static routed region.

    <level_1> - (Required) Level 1 dcp file, SHIM routed with RL and CL as blackboxes.

    <constrset> - (Required) Constraints set to be use with the pr configuration provided in option '-pr_config'.

    <output_dir> - (Required) Directory to save the results.

    <reconfig_partitions> - (Required) Reconfigurable partition instance paths.

    -hpr - (Optional) Enables hierarchical partial reconfiguration flow for raptor, otherwise multi-rl flow is selected for raptor by default.

    -exclude_constrs - (Optional) List of constraint file to be excluded from generation of bit files.    

    -post_link_design_hook - (Optional) List of tcl commands to execute post link design for bit generation step.

    -opt_directive - (Optional) Directive for opt design step.

    -place_directive - (Optional) Directive for place design step.

    -enable_post_place_phys_opt - (Optional) Enable post place physical optimization (Default: 0).

    -post_place_phys_opt_directive - (Optional) Directive for post place phys opt design step.

    -route_directive - (Optional) Directive for route design step.

    -post_route_phys_opt_directive - (Optional) Directive for post route phys opt design step.

    -rl_scripts - (Optional) Directory which has pre/post tcl scripts used after rl platform generation.
                    Inside the folder it will look for pre/post scripts in <pre|post><design step>.tcl format.
                    Example: For design step place_design
                        Pre script  = preplacedesign.tcl
                        Post script = postplacedesign.tcl
    
Examples:

    Below examples are based on a design which has a 'top' bd with top name 'top_wrapper', 'top' bd has a module reference to a partition def 'wrapper' as 'rest',
    'rest' has two module references to partition defs 'dynamic' and 'shell' as 'dynamic_region' and 'shell_region' respectively. 
    'w1', 'user' and 'design_2' are reconfigurable module names.

    1. The following example generates full and partial bitstreams along with base_reset.bit.

       % xilinx::x2rp::raptor -top top_wrapper -level_0 [get_files level_0.dcp] -level_1 [get_files level_1.dcp] -PRP [get_files shell.dcp] -reconfig_partitions {top_i/rest top_i/rest/dynamic_region top_i/rest/shell_region} -output_dir ./output -shell top_i/rest/shell_region -constrset [get_filesets constrs_1]
    
    2. The following example generates full and partial bitstreams along with base_reset.bit (with HPR flow enabled).

        % xilinx::x2rp::raptor -hpr -top top_wrapper -level_0 [get_files level_0.dcp] -level_1 [get_files level_1.dcp] -PRP [get_files shell.dcp] -reconfig_partitions {top_i/rest top_i/rest/dynamic_region top_i/rest/shell_region} -output_dir ./output -shell top_i/rest/shell_region -constrset [get_filesets constrs_1]

    3. The following example generates full and partial bitstreams along with base_reset.bit, for a DCP based PR flow project.

        % xilinx::x2rp::raptor -hpr -pr_config {top_i/rest:rest top_i/rest/dynamic_region:user top_i/rest/shell_region:design_2} -top top_wrapper -level_0 [get_files MET_TIMING.dcp] -output_dir ./output -shell top_i/rest/shell_region -constrset constrs_1
